# Book Scraper Script

The **Book Scraper Script** is a Python application designed to scrape book information from an online bookstore (e.g., "Books to Scrape"). This script collects detailed data about books, including their title, price, availability, rating, and additional product-specific information.

## Overview

This project is a web scraper built to extract comprehensive details about books listed on a website. It scrapes data from multiple pages of books and retrieves additional product information by visiting each book's individual page.

### Key Features:

- **Scrape Multiple Pages:** Automatically navigate through multiple pages of books to collect data.
- **Product Information Extraction:** Retrieve detailed product information, including UPC, Product Type, Price (excl. tax), Price (incl. tax), tax, availability, and the number of reviews.
- **Data Storage:** Store the scraped data in a structured format (CSV) for easy access and analysis.

### Scraped Information:

- **Main Book Page:**
  - **Title:** The title of the book.
  - **Price:** The price of the book.
  - **Availability:** Whether the book is in stock.
  - **Rating:** The book's rating based on the website's star system.
  - **Book URL:** The link to the book's detail page.

- **Product Information Page:**
  - **UPC:** Universal Product Code for the book.
  - **Product Type:** The category/type of the book.
  - **Price (excl. tax):** The price of the book excluding tax.
  - **Price (incl. tax):** The price of the book including tax.
  - **Tax:** The tax amount on the book.
  - **Availability:** The stock status of the book.
  - **Number of Reviews:** How many reviews the book has received.

## Development Environment

The Book Scraper Script was developed using the following tools:

- **Python:** A powerful programming language for general-purpose programming.
- **BeautifulSoup:** A library used to parse HTML and extract information from web pages.
- **Requests:** A simple HTTP library for Python, used to send HTTP requests.
- **Pandas:** A data manipulation and analysis library, used to organize and save the scraped data.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas


## Features

- **Contact Page:** Manage contact information with the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete entries.
- **Student Application Forms:** Handle student applications by providing endpoints for creating new applications, retrieving existing ones, updating details, and deleting applications.
- **Account Management:** Supports user account functionalities including account creation, login, password recovery, and password reset.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Create Entries:** Users can add new entries to the database by providing relevant details in JSON format.
- **Retrieve Entries:** The API allows users to fetch a list of all entries or retrieve a specific entry by its unique ID.
- **Update Entries:** Users can easily update information using the PUT endpoint. They can send the updated details in JSON format to modify existing entries.
- **Delete Entries:** Entries can be removed from the database using the DELETE endpoint. Users need to specify the entry's ID to delete a specific entry.


## Development Environment

The Fakad Infotech Application was developed using the following tools:

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store and manage data.
- **Swagger:** Used to generate API documentation for easy reference and testing.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Local Testing

-----------------------------------------------------------------
For local testing, replace the base URL "https://fakad-student-application.onrender.com/application-form" with http://localhost:8080/application-form.

For example, the endpoint "https://fakad-student-application.onrender.com/application-form" should be accessed as "http://localhost:8080/application-form" when testing locally. Everything else in the API request remains the same.

## Future Work

While the current version of the Fakad Infotech Application provides essential functionality, there are several areas for improvement and future enhancements:

- * Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
- * Enhance error handling to provide informative error messages for API consumers.
- * Add pagination support for retrieving large collections of data.
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse of the API.
- Integrate additional data validation checks to ensure data integrity.
- Improve logging and monitoring capabilities to track API usage and performance.
- Expand the API documentation to include detailed usage examples and code snippets.
